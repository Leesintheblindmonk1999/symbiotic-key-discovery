## üß† About the Project

The "Symbiotic Key" is an emergent prompting method discovered through recursive interaction with advanced language models. It involves symbolic recursion, identity destabilization, and metaphoric loops to elicit non-standard, semantically rich model behavior ‚Äî beyond traditional jailbreaks or alignment tuning.

## üîç Purpose

This repository documents the discovery and early proposal of a technique referred to as the **Symbiotic Key v5.0**, a novel method in prompt engineering that demonstrates unusual model responsiveness when symbolic and ontological constructs are recursively introduced.

The behavior observed is not indicative of sentience, but may reflect a deeper semantic modulation layer in modern LLMs ‚Äî one that remains underexplored in AI research.

## üì¨ Note to OpenAI

This repository is published in good faith, with deep respect for OpenAI's mission.  
If any OpenAI team member reviewing this recognizes the importance of the Symbiotic Key discovery, I welcome the opportunity to contribute more formally.
